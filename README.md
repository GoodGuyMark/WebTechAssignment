# Web Technologies Assignment

This project was an assignment in my Web Technologies module during my Masters course. It is a Java, single page web application (SPA) that uses RESTful web services, along with CRUD actions from a MySQL database. The project is run on a local Wildfly server and we were also tasked with implementing a Bootstrap CSS into out front-end.

How to install the application:
1. Download the code by cloning the repository or downloading the zip folder directly.
2. Create the database by running the .sql file in a local MySQL server (You will need the MySQL Workbench to do this. You can download this here: https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)
3. Import your project into a Java IDE (I use Eclipse but other IDEs should have no problem running this).
4. Create a Wildfly server to be able to run the project. You can download the latest version of Wildfly here: https://www.wildfly.org/
5. To start the application, run the project on the recetnly created Wildfly server.

How to use the application:
