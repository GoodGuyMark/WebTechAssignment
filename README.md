# Web Technologies Assignment

This project was an assignment in my Web Technologies module during my Masters course. It is a Java, single page web application (SPA) that uses RESTful web services, along with CRUD actions from a MySQL database. We were also tasked with implementing a Bootstrap CSS into out front-end and implementing login functionality with an admin dashboard.
